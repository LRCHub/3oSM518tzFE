[00:29.42] It's starting again 'cause I let you in
[00:33.62] This seed I've sown
[00:38.95] Create to condemn, replace to relive
[00:43.72] Despite its growth
[00:46.16] Am I unknown?
[00:48.50] I'm spinning out of control
[00:50.99] I bury it 'til I choke
[00:53.25] On ashes scarring my throat
[01:06.75] 
[01:00.48] You fall away into the light
[01:04.90] Where numbness and pain are synchronized
[01:09.75] If there's a grave behind my eyes
[01:14.44] Then how do the dead find a, find a sign of life?
[01:38.94] 
[01:30.24] Trapped in a maze in my mind, and it's toxic
[01:32.94] I'll scratch my nails through this coffin
[01:35.24] Wasting away in the dark's not an option, not an option, not an option, yeah
[01:45.08] I'll scratch my nails through this coffin
[02:05.58] 
[01:48.24] Too far away to cut the ties
[01:52.51] Where numbness and pain are synchronized
[01:57.37] If there's a grave behind my eyes
[02:01.92] Then how do the dead find a, find a sign of life?
[02:08.22] Find a sign of life
[02:17.72] 
[02:14.24] Bare your soul
[02:23.96] Bare your soul
[02:26.17] It's starting again, won't let you in
[02:30.39] A world unknown
[02:37.89] 
[02:33.08] You fall away into the light
[02:37.52] Where numbness and pain are synchronized
[02:42.43] If there's a grave behind my eyes
[02:47.18] Then how do the dead find a, find a sign of life?
[03:11.68] 
[02:52.98] So pull me close and twist the knife
[02:56.50] And drag me to Hell with Heaven's lies
[03:01.50] If there's a grave behind my eyes
[03:06.36] Then how do the dead find a, find a sign of life?
[03:12.63] Find a sign of life
[03:22.13] 
[03:24.46] Trapped in a maze in my mind, and it's toxic
[03:26.92] I'll scratch my nails through this coffin
[03:29.25] Wasting away in the dark's not an option, not an option, not an option
