Away from the future, we move back to the past Back to when hope was lost and all yours Now i'm standing above your honor I see your true colors Imitation of a perfect person
Hold my ground, hold my ground
The water is rising and i need to find a way out This moment's slipping And i've lost all direction Stand up
Stand up for yourself and what you've dreamed of
My mind has rapidly felt deceiving Explain how we're being discrete For all i know we're the ones who should be afraid Are you conscious?
Are you breathing?
Are you breathing?
Maybe we're not gonna stop her Cause my trust i'm offering Actions will always speak louder than words Are you conscious, are you breathing?
Gone like the wind in a hurricane I'm losing sight and you're losing your mind I hope the view is good from where you stand If this, is what life is, i'm in this until the end
I know we say this all time but, the worst is over
The light thats glaring through the cracks will bring me home
Hold on, the world is falling apart, you don't realize it You are the reason i save myself
For all i know we're the ones who should be afraid Are you conscious?
Are you breathing?
Are you breathing?
Maybe we're not gonna stop her Cause my trust i'm offering Actions will always speak louder than words Are you conscious, are you breathing?
