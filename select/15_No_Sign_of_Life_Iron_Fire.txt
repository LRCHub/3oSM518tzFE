Burning in the desert sun
Last man on the run
Feels like I'm here alone
Still alive in flesh and bone
I keep talking to myself
It's a matter of mental health
I gotta move, step by step
A black world I must intercept

I still believe there must be somebody out there
I guarantee I will search for you everywhere
Even if it takes forever

No sign of, no sign of life
No sign of, no sign of life
No sign of, no sign of life
I walk the endless road
No sign of, no sign of life
No sign of, no sign of life
No sign of, no sign of life
I walk the endless road

I walk the road

That night they took you away
It's a vision on replay
The memories trick my mind
Salvation I must find
From the corner of the apocalypse
On the edge of the abyss
Someday we'll meet again
I won't give in, oh no, my friend

I still believe there must be somebody out there
I guarantee I will search for you everywhere
Even if it takes forever

No sign of, no sign of life
No sign of, no sign of life
No sign of, no sign of life
I walk the endless road
No sign of, no sign of life
No sign of, no sign of life
No sign of, no sign of life
I walk the endless road

No sign of

No sign of, no sign of life
No sign of, no sign of life
No sign of, no sign of life
I walk the endless road
No sign of, no sign of life
No sign of, no sign of life
No sign of, no sign of life
I walk the endless road

No sign of life (No sign of)
No sign of life
