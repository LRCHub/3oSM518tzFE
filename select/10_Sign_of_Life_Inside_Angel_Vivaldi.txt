Shine a light,
Wake the dark,
Feel the sunlight on your skin,
Hear the words that whisper,
So forgotten,

Read the thoughts,
From my eyes,
Never think to question why,
All we have is all we've lost tomorrow

Sever,
Remember,
What is left is not what's wrong,

I Close my eyes
Looking for a sign of life inside
Waiting for a dawn to light my pain,
Just another heartache I've made

Light the fire,
Watch it burn,
Let it feed on all you know,
See the ashes turn to dust and fade away,

Hear the words
From my cries
Never think to question why,
All we have is all we've lost tomorrow
