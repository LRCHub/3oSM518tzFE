It's starting again,
'cause I let you in
This seed I've sown
Create to condemn,
replace to relive
Despite its growth
(Am I unknown?)
Spinning out of control
I bury it till I choke
On ashes scarring my throat
You fall away into the light
Where numbness
and pain are synchronized
If there's a grave
behind my eyes
Then how do the dead find a,
find a sign of life?
Trapped in a maze in my mind
and it's toxic
I'll scratch my nails
through this coffin
Wasting away in the dark's
not an option, not an option,
not an option
I'll scratch my nails
through this coffin
Too far away to cut the ties
Where numbness
and pain are synchronized
If there's a grave
behind my eyes
Then how do the dead find a,
find a sign of life?
(Find a sign of life)
Bare your soul
Bare your soul
(It's starting again,
I won't let you in)
(A world unknown)
You fall away into the light
Where numbness
and pain are synchronized
If there's a grave
behind my eyes
Then how do the dead find a,
find a sign of life?
So pull me close
and twist the knife.
And drag me to Hell
with Heaven's lies
If there's a grave
behind my eyes
Then how do the dead find a,
find a sign of life?
(Find a sign of life)
Trapped in a maze in my mind
and it's toxic
I'll scratch my nails
through this coffin
Wasting away in the dark's
not an option, not an option,
not an option
