A footprint in an alien nation
One step for all mankind
They can't wait for that invitation
To pull around my little mind

Looking for a face in a galaxy of faces
You're really really there
We kinda need you down here

Oh why don't you come and show yourself to me?
(Show yourself to me)
All this universe and no you're not that mean
(No you're not that mean)
Are you out there? Can you sympathize with all us human beings?

Show me a sign of life
Give me a sign of life
Just one sign of life
That's what I need

Beam down through the radiation
A cold earth is what you'll find
That this world is a destination
To close encounter with another kind

Now home base shot a rocket ship of faith
If you really really knew
We kinda need you down here

Oh why don't you come and show yourself to me?
(Show yourself to me)
All this universe and no you're not that mean
(No you're not that mean)
Are you out there? Can you sympathize with all us human beings?

Show me a sign of life
Give me a sign of life
Just one sign of life
That's what I need

Are you real or make believe?
Why won't you let me see?

Oh why don't you come and live your life with me?
(Live your life with me)
All this universe and no you're not that mean
(No you're not that mean)
Are you out there? Can you sympathize with all us human beings?

Show me a sign of life (come show me!)
A sign of life (come show me!)
Sign of life (come show me!)
Sign of life (come show me!)
