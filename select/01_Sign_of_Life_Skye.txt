Set sails overloading breathing through a shell
Divide by only g in me chromosome in all to be revealed
Set sails transforming like a magic spell
Immune female in male the source is flower at well

Living in the light of hope
The sign of a live again
Living in the light of hope
The sign of a live again
Again, again, again

Set sails now revolving spinning out of world
Analysis replay delay who controls this water silver deal
Set sails start of opens heart of seven real
A molecule decode reload another part of me boy or a girl

Living in the light of hope
The sign of a live again
Living in the light of hope
The sign of a live again
Again, again, again

Living in the light of hope
The sign of a live again
Living in the light of hope
The sign of a live again
Again, again, again

Living in the light of hope
The sign of a live again
Living in the light of hope
The sign of a live again
Again, again, again
