We welcome to a empty world
Not a sound, everything was silent
I can see the fear in your eyes
We're the only one left

Are we dreaming, are we alive?
The world is gone as we know it
Surrounded by the dark
Everything's gone

No sign of life
I can't find any survivors
Only you and I
What's left of this world is ours

Yesterday was full of life
But that night something strange happened
And when we started to scream
All we heard was our echo

Are we dreaming, are we alive?
The world is gone as we know it
Surrounded by the dark
Everything's gone

No sign of life
I can't find any survivors
Only you and I
What's left of this world is ours

Are we dreaming, are we alive?
The world is gone as we know it
Surrounded by the dark
Everything's gone

No sign of life
I can't find any survivors
Only you and I
What's left of this world is ours
No sign of life
I can't find any survivors
Only you and I
What's left of this world is ours
